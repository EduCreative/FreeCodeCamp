# FreeCodeCamp
All the FreeCodeCamp practice code is here.

I upload all the practice for future reference and achievement for what I have learned at FreeCodeCamp.

There are many small projects like survey forms, tribute page, designs, animation, etc.
These are really very helpful for a new learner to practice and learn HTML & CSS.
